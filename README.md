Simple **CMake** boilerplate to build your C++ projects.

## How it Works

Pretty simple, **CMake** makes you make files inside *build/* and **make** builds your C++ project.
Your execurable ends up in: *cmake_bp/build/src/cmake_bp*.

## Configure and Build

    cd cmake_bp
    chmod a+x build.sh
    build.sh

## Partial Builds

    cd cmake_bp/build
    make help
    make
